set of scripts to run a sweep of permutations to estimate errors in GC models

The scripts are based on a EMEWS/swift-t template: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~emews

The main script (to launch a "campaign" of jacknife sequences) is:
swift/swift_run_sweep.sh

which can be run as
${EMEWS_ROOTDIR}/swift/swift_run_sweep.sh <name of campaign>


The script contains a set of variables that can be set to change the behavior
MACHINE="" will make it run locally without submittion ("PBS" and so on will change that)

<See email from Justin for more ;-)> 

The run will need an input file, which defined the parameters that will be swept
by the run, in this case the various permutations of a subset of the trials in
the data. The file is in:
data/input.txt

and contains on each line:
<.mat file wit the entirety of the dataset> <mask of 0 and 1> <numerical ID for the specific permutation>

The file is generated using a rscript program
../../R/generatePermutations.R 

The swift scrip will apply the shell script scripts/GC.sh which runs a sequence of 3 compiled matlab 
functions, whose source is in
../../Matlab/
